## SSOpad, weird 18-key macro pad prototype

#### Hardware
see PCB files at: https://github.com/JarofMolasses/SSOpad

#### Supports both Teensy and Pro Micro/Elite-C
the PCB has the reset pins of the Pro Micro broken out for a 6x3.5mm SMD tact switch underneath

#### I2C LCD support based on: https://www.avrfreaks.net/comment/2640876#comment-2640876 
doesn't work properly on Teensy yet for some reason. Works well on Pro Micro in my testing
