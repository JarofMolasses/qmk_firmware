## SSOpad, weird 18-key macro pad prototype

#### Hardware
see PCB design files at: https://github.com/JarofMolasses/SSOpad

#### Supports both Teensy and Pro Micro
but use the Pro Micro, it's better


#### I2C LCD support based on: https://www.avrfreaks.net/comment/2640876#comment-2640876 
this hackjob port does not yet work with Teensy. (It's fine on the Pro Micro)
