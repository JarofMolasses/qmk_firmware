# Hex-Dec-Bin base converter for the SSOpad, 20x4 LCD version
This keymap adds some higher layers which run a simple base converter on the LCD. Takes input in Binary, Decimal, or Hex and returns the result in the other two radices. Still works as a normal macropad too, of course. The inputs are all handled by QMK Macros.

It uses the I2C LCD library ported in here: https://github.com/JarofMolasses/qmk_firmware/tree/I2C_LCD/lib/lcd_dprentice
