# Hex-Dec-Bin base converter for the SSOpad

This keymap adds some higher layers which run a simple base converter on the LCD. One layer for decimal input, one for binary input, etc.\
I used QMK macros to run the code (does not send anything to the host computer from these layers). It is built off of the base LCD keymap here: https://github.com/JarofMolasses/qmk_firmware/tree/I2C_LCD/keyboards/ssopads/ssopadpm1.2/keymaps/LCD
